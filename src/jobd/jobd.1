     jjoobbdd manages jobs that are defined in configuration files located under
     _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_e_t_c_/_j_o_b_._d.  The format of job configuration files is described
     in job(5).

     When a new job configuration file is created, jjoobbdd will automatically
     detect this and load the job into memory. By default, the job will be
     disabled. To enable the job, the jjoobbccttll eennaabbllee command should be
     executed.

     When an existing job configuration file is deleted, jjoobbdd will
     automatically detect this and remove the job from memory. If the job is
     currently running, it will be stopped.

     When an existing configuration file is modified, jjoobbdd will automatically
     detect this and transition the job into the "refresh-needed" state.  This
     alerts the system administrator that the job is running, but with an
     outdated configuration. is outdated and needs to be refreshed. To refresh
     the job, the jjoobbccttll rreeffrreesshh command should be executed.
